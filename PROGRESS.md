## 💡 Notes

### What's Working Great
- ✅ Neomorphic design system is fully functional
- ✅ Animations are smooth and performant
- ✅ Homepage flow is cohesive and engaging
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness is solid
- ✅ Component architecture is clean and reusable

### What Needs Attention
- ⚠️ No navigation yet (users can't navigate between pages)
- ⚠️ Service pages don't exist (links on homepage go nowhere)
- ⚠️ No contact form yet (CTA buttons aren't functional)
- ⚠️ No real images (using placeholders)
- ⚠️ No footer (missing site-wide links and info)

### Recommendations
1. **Priority 1**: Add navigation so users can explore
2. **Priority 2**: Create service pages (they're referenced on homepage)
3. **Priority 3**: Build contact page (CTAs point there)
4. **Priority 4**: Add footer for completeness
5. **Priority 5**: Deploy for client review

### To Test Current Site
1. Ensure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Scroll through the homepage to see all sections
4. Test responsive behavior (resize browser)
5. Check animations (scroll triggers, hover states)

### To Deploy
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with one click
4. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
